Introduction
============

Welcome to the *Ubuntu Server Guide*!

Here you can find information on how to install and configure various
server applications. It is a step-by-step, task-oriented guide for
configuring and customizing your system.

This guide assumes you have a basic understanding of your Ubuntu system.
Some installation details are covered in ?, but if you need detailed
instructions installing Ubuntu please refer to the `Ubuntu Installation
Guide <https://help.ubuntu.com/&distro-rev-short;/installation-guide/>`__.

A HTML version of the manual is available online at `the Ubuntu
Documentation website <&ubuntu-documentation;>`__.

Support
=======

There are a couple of different ways that Ubuntu Server Edition is
supported, commercial support and community support. The main commercial
support (and development funding) is available from Canonical Ltd. They
supply reasonably priced support contracts on a per desktop or per
server basis. For more information see the `Canonical
Services <http://www.canonical.com/services/support>`__ page.

Community support is also provided by dedicated individuals, and
companies, that wish to make Ubuntu the best distribution possible.
Support is provided through multiple mailing lists, IRC channels,
forums, blogs, wikis, etc. The large amount of information available can
be overwhelming, but a good search engine query can usually provide an
answer to your questions. See the `Ubuntu
Support <http://www.ubuntu.com/support>`__ page for more information.
